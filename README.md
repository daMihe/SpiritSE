Spirit SE
=========

*SpiritSE reached it's end of life. It wont be supported, but you can use
it if you want. The App itself works and is relative stable. As Spirit will be
replaced by stud.ip, further development seems to be pointless.*

Spirit Second Edition, written 2013-2014 by Michael Wodniok.
Spirit is a news and schedule platform by the FH Schmalkalden for their 
students. Spirit SE is an app for getting these news and a personalized schedule
to an Android smartphone.

This is a new version of
[Spirit4Android](https://github.com/michiRoxx/Spirit4Android) based on a 
complete new code base.

Requirements of the app
